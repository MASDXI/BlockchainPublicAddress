# BlockchainPublicAddress API User Stories

|  **Item**  |  **Details**  |
| ---------- | ------------- |
|  **US#1**  | User Story #1 |
| ***Summary*** | As an application developer, I want a feature to fetch OB customers Blockchain Public Addresses in a user-friendly way, using Customers Mobile Subscription (i.e. phoneNumber), as a natural and regular pair for the public address of a blockchain. This way management of Blockchain Public Addresses can be perfomed by means of the phoneNumber, which is a natural concept within the OBs. |
| ***Roles, Actors and Scope*** | **Roles:** Customer:User<br> **Actors:** Application service providers, hyperscalers, application developers.  <br> **Scope:** Obtain Blockchain Public Addresses associated to a given phoneNumber of the Customer |
| ***Pre-conditions*** | N/A |
| ***Activities/Steps*** | **Starts when:** The API Consumer makes a GET request to the Blockchain Public Address API to obtain the Blockchain Public Addresses associated to a given phoneNumber (generally such addresses are identified by a DID (Decentralised Identifier, which indeed is a public  address  of a blockchain), composed  of 26-35 alphanumeric  characters in length.<br>**Ends when:** The API Consumer receives GET response with the list of Blockchain Public Addresses associated to the phoneNumber, including this information: <br/> - Blockchain public address name.<br/> - Blockchain public address identifier (DID).<br/> - Blockchain public address identifier binding (for latter management).<br/> - Blockchain public address currency.<br/>Empty response will be received in case no Blockchain Public Address is linked to the phonNumber yet. |
| ***Post-conditions*** | N/A |
| ***Exceptions*** | Several exceptions might occur during the Blockchain Public Address(es) retrieval linked to a given phoneNumber<br>- Unauthorized: Not valid credentials (e.g. use of already expired access token).<br>- Invalid Argument: Not valid phoneNumber.<br>- Internal: Server Error when fetching information. |

|  **US#2**  | User Story #2 |
| ***Summary*** | As an application developer, I want a feature to manage (bind/unbind) OB customers Blockchain Public Addresses in a user-friendly way, using Customers Mobile Subscription (i.e. phoneNumber), as a natural and regular pair for the public address of a blockchain. |
| ***Roles, Actors and Scope*** | **Roles:** Customer:User<br> **Actors:** Application service providers, hyperscalers, application developers.  <br> **Scope:** Manage Blockchain Public Addresses binding/unbinding them to a given phoneNumber of the Customer |
| ***Pre-conditions*** | Blockchain Public Address exists in advance |
| ***Activities/Steps*** | **BINDING PROCESS**<br> **Starts when:** The API Consumer makes a POST request to the Blockchain Public Address API to bind a specific Blockchain Public Addresses to a provided phoneNumber.<br> **Ends when:** The API Consumer receives POST response with this unique binding identifier.<br><br/>**UNBINDING PROCESS**<br> **Starts when:** The API Consumer makes a DELETE request to the Blockchain Public Address API to unbind a specific Blockchain Public Addresses - phoneNumber relationship, providing the binding identifier that identifies such relationship.<br> **Ends when:** The API Consumer receives DELETE response indicating a successful process performed (i.e. deletion). |
| ***Post-conditions*** | **BINDING PROCESS**<br/> Binding relationship between Blockchain Public Address and phoneNumber is created. If making GET request an item showing that binding is included.<br><br>**UNBINDING PROCESS**<br/> Binding relationship between Blockchain Public Address and phoneNumber is deleted. If making GET request the item showing that binding is no longer included. |
| ***Exceptions*** | Several exceptions might occur during the Blockchain Public Address management<br><br>**BINDING PROCESS**<br>- Unauthorized: Not valid credentials (e.g. use of already expired access token).<br>- Invalid Argument: Not valid phoneNumber and/or BlockChain Public Address Information.<br>- Internal: Server Error when fetching information.<br><br>**UNBINDING PROCESS**<br>- Unauthorized: Not valid credentials (e.g. use of already expired access token).<br>- Invalid Argument: Not valid binding identifier.<br>- Internal: Server Error when fetching information.  |

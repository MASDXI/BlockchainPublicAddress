### Items Discussion

Item | Discussion
---- | ---- 
WG Status | Two topics commented:<br> • WG repository information after release generation and merging of [PR#25](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/pull/25). New release is available [Release v0.1.0](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and [README.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/blob/main/README.md) are updated.<br> • Manage members subscription: Klaus and Krzysztof will re-trigger the WG subscription request so as they will enable their subscription and link their github user. Later on, it will be possible to manage them as maintainers/codeowners.
Solving the chain identification issue - [Issue#19](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/issues/19) | Sebastian presented a proposal in order to manage every type of blockchain. Relying in one parameter to identify L1 Ecoystems and other one for identifying L2 and subsequent levels. Pedro and George seems initially OK. Latest comment of using `ethereum` instead of `evm` was in line to indicate real L1 ecosystems within 'blockchain' field, so the reason to also indicate other ecosystems like Avalanch even they have a chainId in evm naming format. This was explained in the meeting as asked by Krzysztof as a doubt. Krzysztof also mentioned whether the list of supported chainIds has to be restricted, Klaus comments that should be left open (initially no restriction in API input); Pedro indicates that in principle API design can support all and to deal with those business scenarios where a given chainId is not supported (a user wallt that does not manage specific blockchains) an exception may be defined. There is more discussion around this topic ( Krzysztof refers to CAIP - https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-2, Klaus also mention to other scheme https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3220), in order to have a flexible way to identify a huge amount of blockchain ecosystems. There is certainty about evm chainId is unique for evm based chains. After some discussion, Klaus comment the idea of having the identification in a common parameter (name to be decided, WG thinks offline) and that parameter indicates the L1-"sub-id" in a flexible way. It seems a way forward and WG will think about a name. In the meantime Pedro will trigger WIP PR to begin to detail this proposal and also improve/evolve with comments received.
Deep Into Use Cases - [Issue#11](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/issues/11) | TEF (Pedro) explains this topic can be resumed in order to improve/enhance description of Use Cases with the context discussed these months. Also provides information about Use Cases TEF business is thinking about. To be checked offline and provide feedback by WG members.
API Enhancement due to Consent Management - [Issue#16](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/issues/16) | Not covered during this meeting.

WG Status | Today joins meeting Jorge Ordovas (TEF, Business Unit Web3 proyects). Currently main focus within WG is an aligment in Blockchain Identification Model. Meeting Minutes from [19/OCT](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-10-19.md) and [02/NOV](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-11-02.md) are available.
Solving the chain identification issue - [Issue#19](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/issues/19) | Proposal is under [PR#30](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/pull/30), some wording comments provided by Rafał (DT), already fixed. Also he refers to Commonalities Issues [camaraproject/Commonalities#77](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/77) and [camaraproject/Commonalities#80](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/80), which are noted to be addressed in this PR or a future one, based on their respective output.<br>Some background context is provided for Jorge (TEF) also understands the rationale of this track.<br>Pending point is to agree on a field name for this concept, some suggestions provided by Pedro (TEF) within the Issue. Georgios (DT) indicates his preference is `blockchainNetworkId`   and also asks whether makes sense to have some alignment in the wording for the BlockChainPublicAddress. Pedro (TEF) comments doesn't think so as this field is to indicate which Blockchain Network the BlockchainPublicAddress belongs to. Some days will be given to provide preferences among participants and selected name will be updated within PR, so as setting for final review.
Deep Into Use Cases - [Issue#11](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/issues/11) | Will be closed during this week if no further comment provided. It can be also discussed in the future.
API Enhancement due to Consent Management - [Issue#16](https://github.com/camaraproject/BlockchainPublicAddress/issues/16) | Feedback from TEF. Business Unit is performing Privacy Assesment about this funcionality, therefore will be kept On-Hold until having their input about this.
